What steps did you take to get the front-end up and running? Any specific challenges?
- Firstly I had to check the nature of the application and the result was that its a Ruby application
- Looking at the source code the applicaiton dependencies were created in the Gemfile i.e vi Gemfile
- The Gemfile.lock followed as needed 
- A Dockerfile was then written to build the image from source code

Building the image was done as follows:
- docker build -t wilbrodchipomho/frontend-app:v9 .
- docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -w /usr/src/app awselscpt/frontend-base bundle install
- docker run -p 8080:4567 wilbrodchipomho/frontend-app:v9 to test that it was up and running
- docker push  wilbrodchipomho/frontend-app:v9

How did you connect the front-end with the back-end? How did you find out what was necessary?


Document the implementation process here. Include all key actions taken (commands, manifest(s), manual actions etc.). Be specific!

- The manifests for both backend and frontend were created as follows, backend-deployment.yaml  backend-service.yaml  frontend-deployment.yaml  frontend-service.yaml

Did you attempt the Bonus question(s)? If yes, please describe how you achieved the results.


What was the most difficult part of the challenge and why?
